## Dotfiles

This is my personal stash of dotfiles, that I manage with [GNU `stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

### Installation
The installation script (in `zsh`) can be used to easly install `stow` and set up these dotfiles in one go:
```sh
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naveen-u/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/install.zsh | zsh
```
